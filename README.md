# Hello!
**My name is Israel, some of you might know that. This README is for a school project**

**I like playing a lot of videogames like Minecraft, Splatoon 2, and PVZ GW2 (Plants Vs. Zombies garden Warfare 2). I also like pizza and talking to my online friends.**

**I have always been interested in coding and something that i might want to do is create a video game, so i guess what I want to do in CS (Computer science) is learn how to code good and get a good grade.**
